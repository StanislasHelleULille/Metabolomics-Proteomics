Blocks both the RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) and NF-kappa-B pathways. Following viral infection  UBXN1 is induced and recruited to the RLR component MAVS. In turn  interferes with MAVS oligomerization  and disrupts the MAVS/TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome. This function probably serves as a brake to prevent excessive RLR signaling. Interferes with the TNFalpha-triggered NF-kappa-B pathway by interacting with cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) and thereby inhibiting their recruitment to TNFR1. Prevents also the activation of NF-kappa-B by associating with CUL1 and thus inhibiting NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha/NFKBIA degradation that remains bound to NF-kappa-B. Interacts with the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer and regulates its activity. Specifically binds 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Interaction with autoubiquitinated BRCA1 leads to the inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer.

Thereby  frees 60S subunit ribosomes from the stalled translation complex and prevents the accumulation of nascent polypeptide chains that are potentially toxic for the cell (PubMed:25578875  PubMed:33406423  PubMed:33909987). Within the RQC complex  NEMF specifically binds stalled 60S ribosomal subunits by recognizing an exposed  nascent chain-conjugated tRNA moiety and promotes the recruitment of LTN1 to stalled 60S subunits (PubMed:25578875). Following binding to stalled 60S ribosomal subunits  NEMF mediates CAT tailing by recruiting alanine-charged tRNA to the A-site and directing the elongation of stalled nascent chains independently of mRNA or 40S subunits  leading to non-templated C-terminal alanine extensions (CAT tails) (PubMed:33406423  PubMed:33909987). Mainly recruits alanine-charged tRNAs  but can also other amino acid-charged tRNAs (PubMed:33406423  PubMed:33909987). CAT tailing is required to promote ubiquitination of stalled nascent chains by different E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (PubMed:33909987). In the canonical RQC pathway (RQC-L)  CAT tailing facilitates LTN1-dependent ubiquitination by exposing lysine residues that would otherwise remain buried in the ribosomal exit tunnel (By similarity). In the alternative RQC pathway (RQC-C) CAT tailing creates an C-degron mainly composed of alanine that is recognized by the CRL2(KLHDC10) and RCHY1/PIRH2 E3 ligases  leading to ubiquitination and degradation of stalled nascent chains (PubMed:33909987). NEMF may also indirectly play a role in nuclear export (PubMed:16103875), Biological process not found.,0,248080,395850,,,

Main component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that binds to a short guide RNA such as microRNA (miRNA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA). RISC uses the mature miRNA or siRNA as a guide for slicer-directed cleavage of homologous mRNAs to repress gene expression. Requires DRB1 for directional loading of the small RNA duplex (guide stand and passenger strand) onto RISC for passenger strand degradation. Unlike animal RISC that associates in high molecular weight complex  Arabidopsis RISC is probably composed only of the AGO1 protein and associated RNA without any other proteins. Associates mainly with miRNAs of 21 nucleotide in length and preferentially recruits small RNAs with a 5' terminal uridine. Associates with 22 nucleotide miRNAs to trigger RDR6-dependent secondary siRNAs biogenesis. This pathway amplifies silencing by using the target RNA as substrate to generate secondary siRNAs. Binds to miR168 which targets its own mRNA for repression  establishing a homeostatic regulatory loop. Involved in antiviral RNA silencing by contributing to viral RNA clearance.

Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB  SNRPD1  SNRPD2  SNRPD3  SNRPE  SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core).

The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export  subcellular mRNA localization  translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The MAGO-Y14 heterodimer inhibits the ATPase activity of EIF4A3  thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The MAGO-Y14 heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator PYM leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm (By similarity). Can increase in vitro the expression from reporter constructs that contain leader introns required for the expression of different genes.

The ternary complex containing UFD1  VCP and NPLOC4 binds ubiquitinated proteins and is necessary for the export of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm  where they are degraded by the proteasome. The NPLOC4-UFD1-VCP complex regulates spindle disassembly at the end of mitosis and is necessary for the formation of a closed nuclear envelope. It may be involved in the development of some ectoderm-derived structures (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon production via the complex formed with VCP and NPLOC4  which binds to RIGI and recruits RNF125 to promote ubiquitination and degradation of RIGI (PubMed:26471729), Ubl conjugation pathway,141080,0,0,,,
